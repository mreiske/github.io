Hello, welcome to my website!

<img align="right" src="./assets/images/IMG_3938.jpeg" alt="IMG_3938" width="150" height="210" >

I am currently a PhD-Candidate at the Berlin School of Economics - Humboldt University Berlin - under the supervision of [Nikolaus Wolf](https://sites.google.com/site/nikolauswolf01). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of quantitative economic history and political economy, with a particular focus on the rise of political extremism in 20th-century Germany. 
In my dissertation, I investigate how economic deprivation and party strategies, such as targeted repressive violence, contributed to the rise of the Nazi party.

  <p>We show how the combination of two economic crises triggered the rise of the NSDAP in rural parts of Weimar Germany. First, rising import competition after 1925, due to exogenous productivity increases in the Americas, drove up agricultural debt and frustration with the democratic political system. Second, price declines during the Great Depression caused  debt deflation, making the debt unsustainable and leading to foreclosures. While traditional agricultural interest parties lost their constituents' loyalty, the NSDAP gained support in areas more affected by this economic deprivation.</p>
